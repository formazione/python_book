Make tests and quizzes with Python and Html

This tool generates html pages with the help of python.

Python (pydarm2.py) makes you:
- read the txt file with the questions in the folder dati
- replace the template html file with the html and javascript with the data from the test you choose
- save the new html file with the new questions, ready to be posted on a site

# What are these files?

This is a tool to make test in html, using python to automatize the process.
The files are:

- pydarm2.py (the main file)
